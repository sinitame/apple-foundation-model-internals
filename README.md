# Apple Foundation Model internals

This repository serves as a technical logbook and knowledge base for my ongoing reverse engineering of Appleâ€™s on-device foundation model framework, introduced in macOS and iOS 26. As an engineer with 5+ years of experience in on-device ML inference, my aim is to make this black box understandable for every developer, and to highlight the clever tricks implemented by Apple engineers along the way.

Each note is a technical log: what I found, how it likely works, and my personal thoughts on why these choices were made and what they bring to the framework.

All findings are based on analysis of publicly available system images and software, combined with references to open research, patents, and prior art.

Feedback and discussion are welcome!
